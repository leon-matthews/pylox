Pure-Python implementation of Lox interpreter.

Starting out as an exact port from the Java version from the book, but it
might be fun to extend things once that is finished. Aribitrary precision
integers and decimals for example, maybe expose some of Python's standard
library.

The implemenation aims to have 100% test coverage, be fully type-
checked at mypy's 'strict' level, and require no external packages.
